# knuth
A repository full of my musings, notes and exercises as I run through the Knuth series.

## Layout
The repository is split up into folders each representing each book in the series.
Each book is split up into their respective chapters which are in turn split into their respective sections
which again in turn are split into their respective subsections.

Each subsection will contain a notes and exercises section.

## Notes
This will contain my various musings, notes, and programs all regarding the content Knuth has laid out in that section
- all of the programs will admittedly be written in javascript for now (I may switch to C++ later) and I will attempt to write
all the notes in markdown (depending on my laziness).

## Exercises
This is similar in content to the notes section except that it will be in regards to the exercises laid out by Knuth.  I will
attempt to do all the exercises I can within reason.
