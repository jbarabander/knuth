##Question: What is the smallest rational number?

##Answer: There is none
Proof (By contradiction):
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>let r be a rational number and assume that if q is a rational number then r < q</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Well then let p = r/2  then p = r/2 < r. and we note that r is rational and 2 is rational so then p must also be rational.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		But that contradicts our original assertion and thereforethere can be no smallest rational number.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>Q.E.D</p>
