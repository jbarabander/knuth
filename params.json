  "body": "# knuth\r\nA repository full of my musings, notes and exercises as I run through the Knuth series.\r\n\r\n## Layout\r\nThe repository is split up into folders each representing each book in the series.\r\nEach book is split up into their respective chapters which are in turn split into their respective sections\r\nwhich again in turn are split into their respective subsections.\r\n\r\nEach subsection will contain a notes and exercises section.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\nThis will contain my various musings, notes, and programs all regarding the content Knuth has laid out in that section.\r\nAll of the programs will admittedly be written in javascript for now (I may switch to C++ later) and I will attempt to write\r\nall the notes in markdown (depending on my laziness).\r\n\r\n## Exercises\r\nThis is similar in content to the notes section except that it will be in regards to the exercises laid out by Knuth.  I will\r\nattempt to do all the exercises I can within reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
